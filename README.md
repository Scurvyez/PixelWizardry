## About

Pixel Wizardry (PW) is a RimWorld mod. It primarily acts as a framework for other modders by introducing new shaders which can be used as fullscreen or thing-specific effects. PW was born out of a desire to practice shader development for myself.

## Goals

1. Modder texture versatility (Linear Dodge, Linear Burn, Multiply, Screen, Subtract, RGB to HSV, Transparent RGB to Grayscale, and Transparent RGB to Black shaders). [DONE]
2. Full-screen shader for enhanced control of Hue, Saturation, and Value. [DONE]
3. Suggestions welcome!

## How-to-Use

1. **Browse the Wiki:** Navigate through the sections to learn about installing the mod, the color blind mode selection, and how to use the framework shaders.
2. **Apply to Your Mod:** Use the knowledge gained from this guide to incorporate shaders into your mods. Experiment with different properties to achieve the desired visual effects.
3. **Community Contributions:** If you have insights or examples to share, feel free to contribute to the project by submitting a pull request or opening an issue. I can always be reached on Discord as well. (steveo.o)
4. **Additional Resources:** If you're a modder using the framework shaders, check out my other project which details RimWorld shaders in full and documents shader basics for a better understanding of what you're doing and why.
