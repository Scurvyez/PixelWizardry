## About

Pixel Wizardry (PW) is a RimWorld mod that does two things. Firstly, it makes the game more accessible to those with color blindness. Secondly, it acts as a framework for other modders by introducing new shaders for their mods and textures. These new shaders for use by other modders primarily consist of effects similar to Photoshop's blending modes such as Linear Burn and Multiply. PW was born out of a desire to see more people enjoy RimWorld in its full glory and as a means of practicing shader development for myself. The base game does not account for color blindness at all and with how popular RimWorld has become I thought it was only appropriate to fix that.

## Goals

1. More accessibility options for the in-game map view (Protanopia, Protanomaly, Deuteranopia, Deuteranomaly, Tritanopia, Tritanomaly, Achromatopsia, and Achromatomaly color blind modes). [DONE] 
2. Modder texture versatility (Linear Dodge, Linear Burn, Multiply, Screen, Subtract, RGB to HSV, Transparent RGB to Grayscale, and Transparent RGB to Black shaders). [DONE]
3. Full-screen shader for enhanced control of Hue, Saturation, and Value. [DONE]
4. Add color blind functionality to all GUI elements as well.
5. Suggestions welcome!

## How-to-Use

1. **Browse the Wiki:** Navigate through the sections to learn about installing the mod, the color blind mode selection, and how to use the framework shaders.
2. **Apply to Your Mod:** Use the knowledge gained from this guide to incorporate shaders into your mods. Experiment with different properties to achieve the desired visual effects.
3. **Community Contributions:** If you have insights or examples to share, feel free to contribute to the project by submitting a pull request or opening an issue. I can always be reached on Discord as well. (steveo.o)
4. **Additional Resources:** If you're a modder using the framework shaders, check out my other project which details RimWorld shaders in full and documents shader basics for a better understanding of what you're doing and why.
