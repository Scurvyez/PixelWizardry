This mod adds several new shaders for use with textures for various things in-game.
Some of the shaders produce blending effects similar to those found in programs like Photoshop.
The currently available, thing-specific, shaders include Linear Dodge (Add), Linear Burn, Screen, Multiply, Subtract, RGBToBlack, RGBToGrayscale, and HSVToRGB.
The only currently available fullscreen effect shader is ScreenHSV which allows the player to adjust the hue, saturation, and value (luminosity) of the entire screen.

See the 1.5/Defs/Misc\ShaderTypeDefs.xml for guidance on how to use the shaders in this mod.

More to come if I have a spark of underwhelming genius or if someone suggests a good one!

A huge thanks to everyone over at the official Rimworld Discord server for all the help and motivation to finish this beast of a mod.
Shoutout to Hershey. You've been the absolute best pal a developer could ask for.
