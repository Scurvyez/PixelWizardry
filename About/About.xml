This mod adds several new shaders for use with textures for various things in-game.
Some of the shaders produce blending effects similar to those found in programs like Photoshop. Some produce more intricate effects and some are full-screen, post-processing effects.

See the GitHub repo's Wiki section for guidance on how to use the shaders in this mod. Link provided above.
More to come if I have a spark of underwhelming genius or if someone suggests a good one!

A huge thanks to everyone over at the official Rimworld Discord server for all the help and motivation to finish this beast of a mod.
Shoutout to Hershey. You've been the absolute best pal a developer could ask for.
