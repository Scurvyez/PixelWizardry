This is a mod adds several new shaders for use with Rimworld textures. Some of the shaders produce blending effects similar to those found in programs like Photoshop.
The currently available shaders include Linear Dodge (Add), Linear Burn, Screen, Multiply, and Subtract, RGBToBlack, RGBToGrayscale, and HSVToRGB. 
In the latest version, I have also included a full-screen, post-processing shader which enables color-blind modes. All 8 forms of color-blindness are supported.
You must enable the correct options for this in the mods' settings to work.

More to come!

A huge thanks to everyone over at the official Rimworld Discord server for all the help and motivation to finish this beast of a mod.
Shoutout to Hershey. You've been the absolute best pal a developer could ask for.
